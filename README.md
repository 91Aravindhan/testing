MANUAL TESTING
1.	Software testing is a process of evaluating a system by manual or automatic means and verify that it satisfies specified requirements or identify differences between expected and actual results.
              Need of software testing.
•	To check the reliability of software.
•	To check the software meets its requirements.
•	To check that users are capable of using the software.

2.	Defect means if tester found any mismatch between expected and actual value, it is also a undesirable state.
3.	Quality is nothing but meeting the customer requirements for the first and every time.
4.	QA
•	Developing the right product
•	It is process oriented
•	Defect prevention based
•	Review(verification)
              QC
•	Developed the right product
•	It is product oriented
•	Defect detection based
•	Testing(validation)
5.	Requirement collection, Requirement analysis, Design, Coding, Testing, Implementation and maintainance
6.	Srs means software requirements specification is a description of a software systems to be developed, laying out functional and non_functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software.
7.	    FRS
It describe the detailed functionality of the system in order to cover clint document to understand functionality of application.
LLD
It describes logic of the each module in order to develop programs
8.	Test strategy, Test plan and review test plan, Test scenario and review test scenario, Test cases preparation and review test cases, Test cases executing defect tracking, test closure.
9.	TEST STRATEGY
It is a high level document which defines the approach of software testing.it is basically derived from BRS.
TEST PLAN
It is derived from SRS
10.	TEST SCENARIO
It is just a flow of the application
What to test
TEST CASES
It is a set of procedures.
How to test
11.	REJECTED
If the developer feels that the bug is not genuine, he rejects the bug
DEFERRED
The bug is expected to be fixed in next releases.priority
13.	OPEN
The developer has started analyzing and working on the defect fix.
REOPEN
If the bug still exists even after the bug is fixed by the developer, the tester changes the status to reopen.
14.	 ERROR: Programmatically mistake or syntax missing leads to error.
              DEFECT: mismatch between expected results and actual results
              BUG     : once developer  accepts testers identified defect.
              FAILURE: defect reaches the customers then is called failure
15.	 PRIORITY
Important of the defect
Inform to developer which defect to be fixed
SEVERITY: Impact of the defect, how severity bug is affecting the application
16. Verification: developing  the right product
Validation:  developed the product right
17. Entry: BRS complete, code build
Exit: unit test has been passed, internal documentation has been updated to          reflect the current state of the product.
18. unit testing, intergation testing, system testing, user acceptance testing
19. EP means equivalence partitioning, it is used to combine same type of test      cases related to single functionality, feature, module
20. test driver is a software component or test tool that replaces a component that takes care of the control and or the calling of a component system.
Test stub is a software component that usually minimally simulates the actions of called components that have not yet been integrated during top down testing
21. statement coverage means execute all statements at least once.
